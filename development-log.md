## Development Log

### Status update one:
Currently facing a road block trying to create a method "data_checker" to check if data has been entered correctly for edge cases. The method is attempting to take in two arguments - the data to check, and the string "num" or "word", to know if you need to check the data for a number (integer or float) or string. Struggling to think about what to check for, my method from now will be to run the program in the terminal and mash some buttons and try to enter nothing to account for edge cases. I will also prompt the user to confirm if the data they have entered is correct, and then loop back to the original question if it was not. The next forseeable challenge will be getting the loop to work, as it is already within a loop. 


### Status update two:
I have just tested the application and it seems to have full basic functionality, which covers the minimum viable product. I have just thoroughly raked over my trello and created a list of priorities. The focus today will be to check all the boxes of the marking rubric. Starting with finishing off another test, I will then build the bash file and test it. Following this I will flesh out the help.md file in terms how I want it to run and instructions for the user to achieve this. Hopefully I will then finish off the control flow diagram and run rubocop over the .rb files, in order to free up friday morning for working on the presentation.
